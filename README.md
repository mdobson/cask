##Toy DB implementation

Basically I want to learn how to implement a simple database to I'm trying out some BitCask stuff. Totally stole inspriation for this from @kevinswiber and his Medea database as well.

##TODOs

1. Adding support for multiple data files in a session
2. Compaction
3. Concurrent reads

What else?
